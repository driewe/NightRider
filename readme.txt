Connected three 74HC595s in series and entertained myself by simulating KITT from Knightrider.  Would have hooked up the fourth one but was running out of realestate and LEDs.  I should have a another breadboard in a few days along with some 7 segment leds that I will be hooking up and controlling with the 74HC595s.
